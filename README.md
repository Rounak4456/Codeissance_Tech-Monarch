cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your database credentials and API keys
```

### Frontend Setup
```bash
# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../frontend
npm install

# Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your backend API endpoint
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Starting the Application
```bash
# Start the backend server
cd backend
npm start

# Start the frontend development server
cd ../frontend
npm start
```

### Installing Browser Extensions
1. Open your browser's extension management page

## üß† How It Works (Detailed Explanation)

### Overall Architecture
DigiPrints follows a modern full-stack architecture consisting of:
- **Frontend**: Single-page application providing user interface
- **Backend**: RESTful API server handling business logic and data management
- **Database**: Persistent storage for user data and activity logs
- **Browser Extensions**: Client-side scripts for real-time privacy protection and data collection

### Core Components Functionality

**Gmail History Reporter Extension:**
- Requests user permission to access Gmail data through Google APIs
- Parses email metadata and content patterns (with privacy safeguards)
- Generates comprehensive reports including sender analysis, frequency patterns, and potential security concerns
- Data is processed locally and optionally synced with the main application

**Privacy Blocker Extension:**
- Intercepts network requests using browser WebRequest APIs
- Analyzes URLs against known tracking domains and suspicious patterns
- Blocks cookies from third-party trackers using declarative net request APIs
- Prevents unauthorized access requests through permission API interception
- Real-time DOM manipulation to remove tracking scripts

**Secure Password Generator Extension:**
- Utilizes cryptographically secure random number generation
- Implements advanced password complexity algorithms
- **Unique QR Code Security**: Generated passwords are encoded into QR codes that can only be decoded by Google's QR scanner, adding an additional security layer against screenshots or clipboard attacks
- Passwords are never stored in plain text, even temporarily

**Data Activity Tracking:**
- Browser extension monitors download events and page navigation
- Securely transmits activity data to backend via encrypted API calls
- Backend processes and stores activity logs with timestamp and metadata
- Frontend displays real-time activity feeds with filtering and search capabilities

**Data Breach Checker Integration:**
- Integrates with external breach monitoring APIs (such as HaveIBeenPwned)
- Hashes email addresses before API queries for privacy protection
- Processes API responses to provide user-friendly breach information
- Implements caching to reduce API calls and improve performance

### Frontend-Backend-Extension Interactions
- Extensions communicate with the main application through secure message passing
- Backend provides centralized API endpoints for all data operations
- Real-time updates are handled through WebSocket connections
- All sensitive data transmission is encrypted and authenticated
